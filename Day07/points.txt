Create a class that contains a deck of cards - 52
'spades diamonds clubs hearts' - number 2-10 + JQKA

the class has methods like __len__ that returns the length of cards in the deck
__getitem__ that returns the position of the card

class FrenchDeck:

>>> deck = FrenchDeck()
>>> deck[0]
Card(rank='2', suit='spades')
>>> deck[-1]
Card(rank='A', suit='hearts')


Packages and Modules
--------------------

Module => library 

Module is any python program which can consist of

1. variables
2. data structures
3. functions
4. classes

modules will have the same extension as any python file - .py

packages  - folders or directories that has one or more modules stored inside


import mymodule as m

from mymodule import greet, Employee

.py -> .pyc (compiled copy or bytecode) => __pychche__ folder


python -m filename

__pychche__ folder - .pyc
